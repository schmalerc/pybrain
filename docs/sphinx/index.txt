.. PyBrain documentation master file, created by sphinx-quickstart on Thu May  1 16:37:40 2008.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyBrain's documentation!
===================================

The documentation is build up in the following parts: first, there is the 
quickstart tutorial which aims at getting you started with PyBrain as quickly as 
possible. This is the right place for you if you just want get a feel for the
library or if you never used PyBrain before.

Although the quickstart uses supervised learning with neural networks as an 
example, this does not mean that that's it. PyBrain is not only about supervised
learning and neural networks.

While the quickstart should be read sequentially, the tutorial's chapters can be
read mostly independent of each other. 

In case this does not suffice, we also have an API reference, the 
:ref:`modindex`. Most of the packages and modules of PyBrain are auto-documented
there.

If at any point the documentation does not suffice, you can always get help at 
the pybrain Google Group at http://groups.google.com/group/pybrain.
